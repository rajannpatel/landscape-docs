Title: API Methods: Event Log

# Event Log

Methods for retrieving or exporting an accountâ€™s Event Log

## GetEventLog

Retrieve event log entries for the account, ordered by creation time.

`days`: The number of days prior to today from which to fetch log entries.
`limit`: The maximum number of results returned by the method. It defaults to 1000.
`offset`: The offset inside the list of results.

For example, the following returns the last 7 days for event log entries in the account, limiting the result to 100 entries:

```text
?action=GetEventLog&days=7&limit=100
```

The method returns a JSON representation of the log entries returned:

```json

    {
        "creation_time": "2014-09-16T18: 37: 45Z",
