Title: API Methods: Saved Searches

# Saved searches

The methods available here are related to saved searches.

## CreateSavedSearch

Create a new saved search associated with the current account.

It requires three arguments:

`name`: The “slug” name for this saved search. It must consist of only lowercase ASCII letters, numbers and hyphens. This is the text which must be used when using the “search:name” syntax. If this parameter is not included a name will be generated automatically based on the title.
`title`: The display name for the saved search.
`search`: The search string to save.

For example, the following request creates a saved search associated with the account:

```text
?action=CreateSavedSearch&name=name1&title=Title%201&search=id:1
```

The method returns a JSON serialized version of the new saved search, like the following result:

```json
{
    "name": "first",
    "title": "First Computer",
    "search": "id:1"
}
```
