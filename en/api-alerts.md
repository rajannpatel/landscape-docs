Title: API Methods: Alerts

# Alerts

Methods for retrieving or editing alerts for an account.

## AlertTagAssociationMethod

A common superclass for alert tag association/disassociation methods.

## AssociateAlert

Associate an alert to computers with specific tags or to all computers.

- `name`: Name of alert type.
- `tags.#`: List of tag names to associate to the alert.
- `all_computers`: true if the alert should be associated to all computers. This parameter is optional and defaults to false. Individual tags associated to the alert will remain, but they will only be effective if the `all_computers` flag is later disabled.

`tags.#` and `all_computers=true` are mutually exclusive.

Example of a valid request that associates the alert `ComputerOfflineAlert` with the tags `desktop` and `laptop`:

```text
?action=AssociateAlert&name=ComputerOfflineAlert
    &tags.1=desktop
    &tags.2=laptop
    &all_computers=false
```

The following errors may be raised:

- `UnknownAlertTypeError`: No alert with the specified name exists.
- `InvalidAlertTypeError`: Raised when trying to associate tags with an alert with account scope instead of computer scope.
- `InvalidParameterCombination`: Some tags were specified and a `true` value for `all_computers` was passed.

The state of the alert will be returned.

## DisassociateAlert

Disassociate an alert from computers with specified tags or from all computers.

If all_computers=true, the alert will be unflagged as applying to all computers, but will still be enabled for computers which have specific tags associated with it.

- `name`: Name of the alert type.
- `tags.#`: List of tag names to disassociate from the alert.
- `all_computers`: If true, the alert will only remain enabled for computers with tags associated to the alert. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.

`tags.#` and `all_computers=true` are mutually exclusive.

Example of a valid request:

```text
?action=DisassociateAlert&name=ComputerOfflineAlert
    &tags.1=desktop&tags.2=laptop
```

The following errors may be raised:

- `UnknownAlertTypeError`: No alert with the specified name exists.
- `UnknownTag`: No tag with the specified name exists.
- `InvalidParameterCombination`: Some tags were specified and a ‘true’ value for ‘all_computers’ was passed.
- `InvalidAlertTypeError`: Raised when trying to discassociate tags with an alert with account scope instead of computer scope.

The state of the alert will be returned.

## GetAlertSubscribers
